# Sherpad Environment Configuration
# 
# This is an example file. The actual environment file is at:
#   /opt/sherpa/config/sherpad.env
#
# The environment file is automatically created during installation
# with the database password you provided.

# Database password (required)
SHERPA_DB_PASSWORD=YourSecurePasswordHere

# Rust logging configuration
# Controls the verbosity of sherpad logs written to /opt/sherpa/logs/sherpad.log
#
# Available log levels (from least to most verbose):
#   - error: Only critical errors that prevent operations
#   - warn:  Warnings and errors (non-critical issues)
#   - info:  General operational messages (recommended for production)
#   - debug: Detailed information useful for troubleshooting
#   - trace: Very verbose, includes all internal operations
#
# Default: info (if not set)
# Recommended: info for normal operation, debug for troubleshooting
RUST_LOG=info

# Advanced: Per-module log filtering (optional)
# You can set different log levels for different components to reduce noise
# from dependencies while keeping detailed logs for sherpad itself.
#
# Example: Set sherpad to debug, but reduce dependency verbosity:
# RUST_LOG=sherpad=debug,bollard=warn,surrealdb=warn,virt=warn
#
# Common dependencies to consider filtering:
#   - bollard:    Docker client library
#   - surrealdb:  Database client
#   - virt:       Libvirt client
#   - tower_http: HTTP server middleware

# Custom configuration (add as needed)
# SHERPA_CUSTOM_VAR=value
